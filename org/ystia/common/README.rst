Common
------

This is a technical component that contains TOSCA types and utility scripts used by all the Ystia components.

The TOSCA types are derived from TOSCA normative types such as ``tosca.nodes.Root``, ``tosca.nodes.SoftwareComponent``, ``tosca.relationships.ConnectsTo``, etc....

The scripts are grouped in artifact named **utils_scripts** in order to factorize the common util scripts for whole Ystia components.
